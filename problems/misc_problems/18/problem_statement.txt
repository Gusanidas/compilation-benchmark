Create a program to manage a military hierarchy system. Implement the following features:
AddSoldier: Takes three arguments:

ID (integer from 1 to N with no gaps)
Rank (integer from 1 to 10)
SuperiorID (integer, representing the ID of this soldier's direct superior)
Returns true if the soldier was added successfully.
A soldier can be added before their superior, and the output should be true.

FindCommonSuperior: Takes two arguments:

FirstID (integer, representing the ID of the first soldier)
SecondID (integer, representing the ID of the second soldier)
Returns the ID of the lowest-ranking common superior in the hierarchy for these two soldiers. If multiple common superiors exist, return the one with the lowest rank.
If one soldier is the superior of the other, return the ID of the superior.
If no common superior exists, or the soldiers have not been added, return False.
If one of the soldiers has a superior that has not been added, return False.

The program should read input from stdin and print output to stdout, with each line of input corresponding to one line of output.
