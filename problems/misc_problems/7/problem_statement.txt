Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following specifications:

1. The tree should store integer values
2. Each node can have at most two children
3. For any node:
   - All values in the left subtree must be less than the node's value
   - All values in the right subtree must be greater than the node's value
4. Duplicate values are not allowed

Required Operations:
- insert(value): 
  * Adds a value to the tree while maintaining BST properties
  * Returns 1 if insertion was successful
  * Returns 0 if value already exists in tree
  
- search(value):
  * Checks if a value exists in the tree
  * Returns 1 if found
  * Returns 0 if not found

Example Tree after insertions:
       5
      /
    3     7
      4

Input format:
- Each line contains one operation: either "insert X" or "search X" where X is an integer
- Operations should be processed in order
