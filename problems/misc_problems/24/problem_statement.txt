Problem Statement:
Write a function that processes an array of integers and returns a new array where:

Integers are grouped by their frequency in descending order (i.e., numbers that appear more often come first).
If two numbers have the same frequency, they are sorted in ascending order within their group.
The input array can contain both positive and negative integers.

Example Input:
1 3 4 2 2 4 1 4
2 1 1

Example Output:
4 4 4 1 1 1 2 2 3
