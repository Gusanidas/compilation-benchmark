Write a function that finds all "peak elements" in an array. A peak element is greater than both its adjacent elements. Elements at the edges (first and last positions) are considered peaks if they are greater than their single adjacent element.
Constraints:

The input array will contain integers between -10^9 and 10^9
The array length will be between 1 and 10^5 elements
Each number in the array is guaranteed to be unique
