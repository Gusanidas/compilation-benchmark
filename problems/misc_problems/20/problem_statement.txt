Create a program to manage a social network where users can establish friendships with other users. The program should read commands from standard input, one per line, and produce an output for each command.
Implement the following operations:
Add a user:

Input: username (string, unique), name (string), age (integer)
Output: Returns true if the user was successfully added, false if the username already exists
Example: AddUser john_doe "John Doe" 25

Remove a user:

Input: username
Output: Returns true if the user was successfully removed, false if the user doesn't exist
Example: RemoveUser john_doe

Add a friendship:

Input: username1, username2
Output: Returns true if the friendship was successfully created, false if either user doesn't exist or if they're already friends
Note: Friendship is mutual - if user A is friends with user B, then user B is friends with user A
Example: AddFriendship john_doe jane_smith

Remove a friendship:

Input: username1, username2
Output: Returns true if the friendship was successfully removed, false if either user doesn't exist or if they weren't friends
Example: RemoveFriendship john_doe jane_smith

Get friends:

Input: username
Output: Returns a comma-separated list of usernames (sorted alphabetically, without spaces) representing the user's friends
Returns an empty string if the user has no friends
Returns false if the user doesn't exist
Example: GetFriends john_doe

DegreeOfSeparation:

Input: username1, username2
Output: Returns an integer representing the minimum number of connections needed to reach from username1 to username2

Returns 0 if it's the same user
Returns 1 if they are direct friends
Returns 2 if they have a friend in common
Returns 3 if they are connected through two intermediate friends
And so on...
Returns -1 if there is no path between the users or if either user doesn't exist
Example: DegreeOfSeparation john_doe jane_smith



Example input:
AddUser john_doe "John Doe" 25
AddUser jane_smith "Jane Smith" 28
AddUser bob_wilson "Bob Wilson" 30
AddUser alice_brown "Alice Brown" 22
AddUser carol_davis "Carol Davis" 27
AddFriendship john_doe jane_smith
AddFriendship bob_wilson alice_brown
AddFriendship jane_smith alice_brown
DegreeOfSeparation john_doe jane_smith
DegreeOfSeparation john_doe bob_wilson
DegreeOfSeparation john_doe john_doe
DegreeOfSeparation john_doe carol_davis
GetFriends john_doe
RemoveFriendship john_doe jane_smith
DegreeOfSeparation john_doe alice_brown

Example output:
