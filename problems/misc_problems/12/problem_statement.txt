Create a program to manage participants and events that have a many-to-many relationship. Each participant can attend multiple events, and each event can have multiple participants.

Implement the following operations, each provided as a command through standard input. Every command must produce an output:

Add a participant: Arguments include the participant’s name and unique ID. Returns true if the participant was successfully added.
Add an event: Arguments include the event’s name and unique ID. Returns true if the event was successfully added.
Assign a participant to an event: Arguments include the participant’s ID and the event’s ID. Returns true if the assignment was successful.
Get all events for a participant: Argument is the participant’s ID. Returns a comma-separated list of event IDs that the participant is currently attending, sorted in ascending order and without spaces.
Get all participants for an event: Argument is the event’s ID. Returns a comma-separated list of participant IDs who are currently attending the event, sorted in ascending order and without spaces.
All commands are read from standard input, one per line, and every command must produce an output line.
