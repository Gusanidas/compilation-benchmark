Create a program to find the shortest contiguous sequence of soldier IDs containing specified ranks. Implement the following features:

AddSoldier: Arguments are ID (integer) and rank (string). IDs must be from 1 to N with no gaps. Return true if the soldier was added successfully.
FindRanks: Arguments are one or more ranks. Return two numbers representing the start and end IDs of the shortest contiguous sequence containing all specified ranks, separated by a comma.
If no such sequence exists, return False. If multiple sequences have the same length, return the one with the smallest start ID.

The input is going to be given by stdin, and you should print the output.
Each line of input should have a line of output.
